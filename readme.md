#### Features in Monopoly_in_ruby

**Perchase Property:**

   If the player lands on an unowned property, the player may buy it for the price listed on that property's space. If they agree to buy it, they pay the Bank the amount shown on the property space and receives the deed for that property. If they refuse to buy the property for the amount stated on the deed, the property is auctioned. Bidding may start at any price, and all players may bid. The highest bidder wins the property and pays the Bank the amount bid and receives the property's title deed. Railroads and utilities are also considered properties.

**Property Rent**

   If the player lands on an unmortgaged property owned by another player, they pay rent to that person, as specified on the property's deed. It is the property owner's responsibility to demand rent, and they have until the beginning of the second following player's turn to do so.
   If the player lands on their own property, or on property which is owned by another player but currently mortgaged, nothing happens.

**Free Parking**

+ A player landing on this space does not receive any money,perperty or reward of any kind, this is just a "free" resting place.

+few systems that we need to do in future : we haven't work on the Jai system, go system which  they collect $200 when they pass GO, and either does the income tax system that collect the persentage system they earn each 10 turns, house selling system, hotel system, and stock system.who throw dice first system,mortgages system
